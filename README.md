# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic SPA where you can play tic-tac-toe!
It was coded by me using the <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe">Tic-Tac-Toe React Tutorial</a> as a reference.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run it

    1. Clone the repository or fork it;
    2. Run `npm install`;
    3. Run `npm start`!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
